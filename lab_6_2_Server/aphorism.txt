Success is the child of audacity/Success is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration/Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm/You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take/It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change/Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs/The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential… these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence/Fall seven times and stand up eight/There are no shortcuts to any place worth going/Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success
