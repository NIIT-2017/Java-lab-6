Actions speak louder than words
All for one and one for all
Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes
Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
Give him an inch and he'll take a mile
